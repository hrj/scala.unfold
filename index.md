# A Gentle Introduction to Scala

``` scala
println("Hello world")
```

[Scala](http://scala-lang.org/) is a programming language created by Martin Odersky. This guide is a gentle
introduction to the Scala language.

### Intended Audience
If you are familiar with basic concepts in computer science, familiar with atleast
one programming language (doesn't matter which), and want to quickly get upto speed with Scala,
then you are the intended audience of this little guide.

If you don't know any programming language yet, it is best to learn
a simpler language before jumping in to Scala, in the author's humble opinion.
