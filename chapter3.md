# Basics

This chapter is best tried out in Scala REPL. See [chapter 1](chapter1) to know
more about REPL.

## Defining values

Simple expressions:

``` scala
val a = 10
val b = a * 20
```

Error if:
a = 30

Blocks

```
val c = {
  val d = a * a
  d / 2
}
```

## Defining variables

```
var v = 30
v = 40
```

## Defining functions

```
def square(x:Int) = x * x
```

## Control statements

### if else

### while, do while

### for loops
none, wait for it.
